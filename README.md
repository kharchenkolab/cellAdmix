# cellAdmix

Evaluating and correcting cell admixtures in imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data.

The repository currently contains a [vignette](https://nbviewer.org/github/kharchenkolab/cellAdmix/blob/main/vignettes/NSCLC_tutorial.ipynb) illustrating admixture impact on regional DE analysis, and the effect of factorization-based correction on the NSCLC dataset.
